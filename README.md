# Flappy Bird AI
Flappy Bird remade in &lt;300 lines and an AI to play it

## Requirements

```pip install pygame neat-python```

## How to play

Run `flap.py` to play Flappy Bird yourself. Press `Up Arrow` to flap, `Space` to reset the game. You can adjust the simulation rate, gravity strength, pipe spacing, and flap impulse in the code if you wish.

Run `flappy_ml.py` to use Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT), a genetic algorithm, to evolve an AI to play the game! It is highly likely that the AI becomes perfect at the game by the 10th generation.
